# 30-Day-SOC-Analyst-Challenge
A 30-day hands-on SOC Analyst project simulating real-world cyber attacks using ELK Stack, Mythic C2, osTicket &amp; Elastic Defend. Covers threat detection, log analysis, incident response, and cloud-based SOC setup to bridge academic theory with practical cybersecurity skills.
This repository documents the 30-Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge, a hands-on cybersecurity project focused on building and managing a fully functional Security Operations Center (SOC) using open-source tools and cloud infrastructure. The project includes simulated real-world attack scenarios (e.g., brute force, C2 operations), log analysis, threat detection, and incident response using tools like the ELK Stack, Mythic C2, osTicket, and Elastic Defend. It bridges academic knowledge with real-world SOC operations and lays the groundwork for future enhancements in automation, threat intelligence, and scalability.
